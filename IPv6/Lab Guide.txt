IPv6 Instruction
Network:
2620:E4:C000::/64 assigned prefix to Champlain College
2001:1890:139D::/64 assigned prefix to Middlebury College
1800:2200:185::/64 is the network used by the ISP, VTEL, to connect Champlain and Middlebury
Step 1 - Configure the Champlain router
Assign a General Prefix for the internal Champlain network
From config mode: "ipv6 general-prefix [prefix_name] [champlain_ipv6_prefix]"
prefix_name: CC_prep
champlain_ipv6_prefix: 2620:E4:C000::/64
Configure Ethernet0 with an IP address using the named general prefix, and make sure interface is not shut down
From config mode: interface e0
ipv6 address CC_prep ::0:0:0:1/64
no shut
Enable IPv6 local routing
From config mode: ipv6 unicast-routing
Step 2 - Configure Champlain host
Use this command to auto-assign an IP address based on the local routers prefix and the host MAC address
ip auto

Test: ping 2620:E4:C000::1
Step 3 - Configure the Middlebury router with prefix_name: MC_prep and IPv6_prefix from the Network
Step 4 - Configure Middlebury host with the command "ip auto", and ping to Middlebury router for testing
Step 5 - Configure VTEL router
Enable IPv6 local routing
From config mode: ipv6 unicast-routing
Assign an IP address to Fa0 using the "eui" shortcut and make sure interface is not shut down
From config mode: interface fa0
ipv6 address [vtel_ipv6_prefix] eui-64
no shut
Step 6 - Configure Champlain router and Middlebury router ISP interface to get IPv6 address
On both routers
From config mode: interface fa0
ipv6 address autoconfig
no shut
Use "show ipv6 interface brief" and ping for testing
Step 7 - Configure IPv6 RIP so that routers are broadcast
On all 3 routers, and each interface using IPv6, enable RIP with process number
From config mode: interface fa0/e0
ipv6 rip processX enable (X can be any number but "1" is common)
Exit config mode, and run the command "show ipv6 route" to see all networks
From Champlain host, ping to Middlebury host for testing
