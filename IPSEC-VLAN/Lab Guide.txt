SPRINT 1 - INTERNET PROTOCOL SECURITY Site-to-Site - VPN
INSTRUCTION_

Given network:
Champlain Public network: 216.93.144.0/24

Champlain Private network: 172.16.84.0/24

UVM Public network: 140.230.18.0/24

UVM Private network: 192.168.25.0/24

1. Network configuration
Assign IP addresses to all routers and PCs

Assign default routes on Champlain and UVM routers to point to ISP

Champlain Router # ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 216.93.144.15

UVM Router # ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 140.230.18.15

Ping from Champlain Public IP to UVM Public IP for testing
2. Configure Champlain Route
From Config mode:
#access-list number permit ip src_net src_mask_wildcard dst_net dst_mask_wildcard

source network is Champlain private

destination network is UVM private

number can be any bumber above 100

2.1. Configure IKE Phase 1 ISAKMP Policy on Champlain router

From Config mode:
#crypto isakmp policy 10

#encryption aes 256

#authentication pre-share

#group 5

#exit

#crypto isakmp key CCC412 address public_ip_uvm_router

2.2. Configure IKE Phase 2 IPSEC policy

From Config mode:
#crypto ipsec transform-set VPN-SET esp-aes esp-sha-hmac

#crypto map VPN-MAP 10 ipsec-isakmp

#description VPN connection to UVM

#set peer public_ip_uvm_router

#set transform-set VPN-SET

#match address 100

#exit

2.3. Configure crypto map on the outgoing interface

From Config mode:
#interface FastEthernet 0/0

#crypto map VPN-MAP

3. Configure UVM Router (do the same steps to configure Champlain router on the UVM router,
make sure change the addresses and other settings)

4. Verification
Exit Config mode and run the command "crypto ipsec sa" to view SA set up correctly
5. Ping between Champlain PCs and UVM PCs in both directions to generate some traffic
6. IfVPN set up correctly, run the command "show crypto ipsec sa" to view encrypted packets
